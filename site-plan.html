      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When is the last time you knocked your competition out of the sky? Probably never. You probably still lose to 12 year-old's playing Fortnite! Are you tired of crash landing into failure every time you start up a Minecraft? Well I'm here to help. I'm the owner of Starmite Gaming, where we have everything necessary to make you as mighty as the stars, from gaming classes to star-tier computers. Are you ready to shine with the stars?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We're looking for those who love video games. It doesn't matter if you just started playing Valheim yesterday, or have been playing since computers were created. It doesn't matter if you win every game you play, or only know how to take last place. For those who are at the top, we'll help you get a star-tier gaming setup. For those who are new, we'll help you get a starter gaming set and teach you how to shine.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      
      
      <h3>Ideas</h3>
      <h4>Why Starmite Gaming?</h4>
      <p>Gamers will visit to upgrade their gaming. They can use this as a site to receive recommendations for and buy pre-built PCs, pick PC parts, and other gaming accessories. They will also come for virtual gaming classes where they will learn strategies to improve reaction time, notice the small details, and configue settings for the best chances of winning.</p>
        
        <h4>PC Builds</h4>
      <p>We will have information on all of the latest PC parts. Whether or not gamers need the Nvidia GTX 3060 or 3080? Whether they should get an AMD or Intel CPU? Whether they need an R5 or R9? Do you really need the best of the best, or will a budget PC still be able to supercede your needs? We will recommend gaming builds, and pre-built PCs. We will also allow them to buy them from our site.</p>
      
      <h4>Gaming Accessories</h4>
      <p>Additionally, we will recommend gaming accessories. Should you buy a Steel Series or Turtle Beach headset? Is a $300 headset that much better than a $100 dollar headset? What monitor, mouse, and keyboard will best fit your needs? Should you go with a wireless keyboard and mouse or wired? Should you buy a monitor that focuses on low latency or color reproduction?</p>
      
      <h4>Gaming Classes</h4>
      <p>Last but not least, a perfect gaming rig can only take you so far. Arguably, the most important part is your skill. That is why we offer classes on how to improve your gaming skills. Do you lose before you even know what's going on? We have classes on analyzing your surroundings to notice your enemies. Do you often find yourself being out-maneuvered by your opponents? Learn how to plan for their next move and take advantage of that. Are you looking to improve your skills in a certain game? We offer classes about specific games and what you can do to become a legend in that specific game? Are you confused about all of those video, graphic, and audio settings? We will teach you what each setting does, and how to optimize them for your gaming rig.</p>

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

      <p>
        I decided to go with a more retro feel, with the pixelated letters. If for some reason it doesn't work it will default to a serif font. <!-- change this -->
      </p>
      
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: VT323  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Very similar reasoning to the above font, I wanted that retro feel. This is a gaming website after all. It will default to a sans-serif font.  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example

      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.
