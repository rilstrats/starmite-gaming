            When is the last time you knocked your competition out of the sky?
            Probably never. You probably still lose to 12 year-old's playing
            Fortnite! Are you tired of crash landing into failure every time you
            start up a Minecraft? Well I'm here to help. I'm the owner of
            Starmite Gaming, where we have everything necessary to make you as
            mighty as the stars, from gaming classes to star-tier computers. Are
            you ready to shine with the stars?

            We're looking for those who love video games. It doesn't matter if
            you just started playing Valheim yesterday, or have been playing
            since computers were created. It doesn't matter if you win every
            game you play, or only know how to take last place. For those who
            are at the top, we'll help you get a star-tier gaming setup. For
            those who are new, we'll help you get a starter gaming set and teach
            you how to shine.

            We want to level up your gaming. You can use this as a site to
            receive recommendations for pre-built PCs, pick PC parts, and other
            gaming accessories. You can also participate in our virtual gaming
            classes where you can learn strategies to improve reaction time,
            notice the small details, and configue settings for the best chances
            of winning.

          <p class="home-pc-text">
            We have the information on all of the latest PC parts. Whether or
            not you need the Nvidia GTX 3060 or 3080? Whether you should get
            an AMD or Intel CPU? Whether they need an R5 or R9? Do you really
            need the best of the best, or will a budget PC still be able to
            supersede your needs? We recommend gaming builds and pre-built PCs.
          </p>

          <p class="home-pc-text">
            Additionally, we recommend gaming accessories. Should you buy a
            Steel Series or Turtle Beach headset? Is a $300 headset that much
            better than a $100 dollar headset? What monitor, mouse, and keyboard
            will best fit your needs? Should you go with a wireless keyboard and
            mouse or wired? Should you buy a monitor that focuses on low latency
            or color reproduction?

            Last but not least, a perfect gaming rig can only take you so far.
            Arguably, the most important part is your skill. That is why we
            offer classes on how to improve your gaming skills. Do you lose
            before you even know what's going on? We have classes on analyzing
            your surroundings to notice your enemies. Do you often find yourself
            being out-maneuvered by your opponents? Learn how to plan for their
            next move and take advantage of that. Are you looking to improve
            your skills in a certain game? We offer classes about specific games
            and what you can do to become a legend in that specific game? Are
            you confused about all of those video, graphic, and audio settings?
            We will teach you what each setting does, and how to optimize them
            for your gaming rig.
